# Evaluating Clustering Performance Using Advanced Techniques

# The elbow method and silhouette coefficient evaluate 
# clustering performance without the use of ground truth labels.
# Ground truth labels categorize data points into groups based 
# on assignment by a human or an existing algorithm. 
# These types of metrics do their best to suggest the correct
# number of clusters but can be deceiving when used without context.
# When comparing k-means against a density-based approach on 
# nonspherical clusters, the results from the elbow method and 
# silhouette coefficient rarely match human intuition. This scenario 
# highlights why advanced clustering evaluation techniques are necessary. 
# To visualize an example, import these additional modules:
